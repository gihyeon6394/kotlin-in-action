## 1. Creating collections in Kotlin

## 2. Making functions easier to call

### Named arguments

### Default parameter values

### Getting rid of static uitility classes: top-level functions and properties

## 3. Adding methods to other people’s classes: extension functions and properties

### imports and extensions functions

### Calling extension functions fromjava

### No overriding for extension functions

### Extension properties

## 4. Working with collections: varargs, infix calls, and library support

### Extending the Java Collections API
