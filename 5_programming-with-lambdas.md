## 1. Lambda expressions and member references

### Introduction to lamdas: blocks of code as function parameters

### Lamdas and collections

### Syntax for lamda expressions

### Accessing variables in scope

### Member references

## 2. Functional APIs for collections

### Essentials: filter and map

### "all", "any", "count", and "find": applying a predicate to a collection

### groupBy: converting a list to a map of groups

### flatMap and flatten: processing elements in nested collections

## 3. Lazy collection operations: sequences

### Executing sequence operations: intermediate and terminal operations

### Creating sequences

## 4. Using Java functional interfaces

### Passing a lamda as a parameter to a Java method

### SAM constructors: explicit conversion of lamdas to functional interfaces

## 5. Lanmdas with receiver: "with" and "apply"

### The "with" function

### The "apply" function
