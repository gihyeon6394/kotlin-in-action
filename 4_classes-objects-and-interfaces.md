## 1. Defining class hierarchies

### Interfaces in Kotlin

### Open, final and abstract modifiers: final by defaultÂ¬

### Visibility modifiers: public by default

### Inner and nested classes: nested by default

### Sealed classes: defining restricted class hierarchies

## 2. Declaring a class with nontrivial constructors or properties

### Initializing classes: primary constructor and initializer blocks

### Secondary constructors: initializing the superclass in different ways

### Implementing properties declared in interfaces

### Accessing a backing field from a getter or setter

### Changing accessor visibility

## 3. Compiler-generated methods: data classes and class delegation

### Universal object methods

### Data classes: autogenerated implementations of universal methods

### Class delegation: using the "by" keyword

## 4. The "object" keyword: declaring a class and creating an instance, combined

### Object declarations: singletons made easy

### Companion objects: a place for factory methods and static members

### Companion objects as regular objects

### Object expressions: anonymous inner classes rephrased
